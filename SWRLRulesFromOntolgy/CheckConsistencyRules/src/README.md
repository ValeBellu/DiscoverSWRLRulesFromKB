# CheckPatternMultiThreading

This module is used to test whether the SWRL rules are consistent or not when considered jointly with the reference ontology. Here we use 10 threads to test 10 rules at the same time, this increases the processing speed of the program.

- The module's input is located in the function “main” of the file: MainClass.java
- The module's output is a file .txt containing SWRL rules to be consistent.
